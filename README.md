An example bot implemented in JavaScript

If you are looking for the java example bot please go [here](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotJavaExample)

## Installation guide

If you've installed a few other npm packages already, chances are doing `npm install SuperVK/RLBotJS` works.

1. Clone this repo

2. Go into the folder, and type `npm install`

### if `npm install` gives an error follow this guide:

1. Install python 2.7, but make sure to **not** check "add to PATH" in the installation, because then the python runner for RLBot won't run anymore

2. Then run `npm config set python="C:\path\to\python2.7\python.exe"`

3. Open a shell with admin access, and run `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools --vs2015`, if it can't find npm launch powershell instead of cmd.

4. Then run `npm install again`

5. Open cmd/powershell in the example folder, and run `node .`

6. Start RLBot with gui or via `RLBotJavascriptExample/rlbot/run.bat`
