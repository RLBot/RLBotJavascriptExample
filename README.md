## Installation guide

If you've installed a few other npm packages already, chances are doing `npm install rlbot` works.

# if `npm install rlbot` gives an error follow this guide:

1. Install python 2.7, but make sure to not check "add to PATH" in the installation, because then the python runner for RLBot won't run anymore

2. Open a shell with admin access, and run `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools --vs2015`, if it can't find npm launch powershell instead of cmd.

3. Then run `npm install --python=C:\path\to\python2.7\python.exe rlbot`
